<p>Jobberbase is an open-source job board platform that enables the creation of job sites.</p>

<p>For comparison, Jobberbase is for job sites what WordPress is for blogs.</p>

<p>Since launch, Jobberbase was downloaded more than 100,000 times.</p>


<h3>A bit of history</h3>

<p>Jobberbase was born in October 2007.</p>

<p>Filip had previously created <a href="http://www.jobber.ro">http://www.jobber.ro</a>, a tech-only job board that quickly became known and loved in the Romanian tech community.</p>

<p>As an experiment and being influenced by how Ruby on Rails (framework) came out of Basecamp (product), Filip decided to open-source jobber, 3 months after launch.</p>

<p>Jobberbase was the first open-source job board platform, a breath of fresh air in a world where all other similar software was legacy, ugly and paid-for, thus challenging the status quo.</p>

<p>Over the next few years, Jobberbase gained popularity and a few core contributors, most notably Lavi &amp; Cosmin Mendrea and Radu Lucaciu who were also heavily involved in the community, helping people out. Other developers started to make a living by customising and extending Jobberbase for their clients. New visual themes were created...</p>

<p>Good times!</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Jobberbase, life happened and the project slowly fell into oblivion. It was nice, it had potential, but we just didn't have time...</p>


<h3>Status quo (December 2014)</h3>

<p>Having received unexpected help from @rimas-kudelis, we've since launched <a href="https://github.com/filipcte/jobberbase/releases/tag/2.0">version 2.0</a> with significant changes and many additions.
